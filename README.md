# Box-Wrapper-Machine-

Unzip the file BWM and then open "Main project 1.project" in codesys software.
In Box Wrapper Machine you can get all the schematic and circuits diagram. 

Highlights:
- Power Distribution: Connected Main MCB to two VFDs (0.55kW for rotational motor and 0.37kW for up/down motor) and a power supply.
- PLC Integration: Implemented a PLC with an analog module for motor control and sensor feedback.
- CoDeSys Simulation: Created two ladder logic programsâ€”one for animated visualization and another for comprehensive control logic.
- System Features: Seamless motor control, safety features (overload signals, emergency stops), and real-time monitoring.

This project showcases how detailed schematics and advanced programming can bring a basic industrial machine to life.
